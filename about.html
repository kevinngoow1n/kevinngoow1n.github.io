        <h1>Transforming Healthcare Through Data and Innovation</h1>
        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi, I’m Kevin Nguyen — a data-driven health informatician passionate about improving healthcare through technology and innovation. <br> 
            I grew up in Orange County, California, and earned my Bachelor of Science in Public Health with a concentration in Epidemiology and a minor 
            in Mathematics from the University of California, San Diego (UCSD). During my undergraduate studies, I strengthened my foundation in data 
            science through coursework in biostatistics, computational statistics, and data analysis—realizing early on that the future of healthcare 
            would be shaped by data and technology. <br>
            Currently, I’m pursuing my Master of Science in Health and Clinical Informatics at Oregon Health & Science University (OHSU) in 
            Portland, Oregon. Health informatics represents the perfect intersection of the fields I am passionate about: healthcare to give back to 
            the community, data to apply analytical insights, and technology to drive the future of medicine. <br>
            Throughout my academic and professional career, I've worked on a range of projects, from HIV network modeling to building dashboards for 
            state health authorities and analyzing COVID-19 exposure notification data alongside partners like Google, Apple, UC San Diego Health, and 
            the California Department of Public Health. I am skilled in R, Python, Matlab, JavaScript, Tableau, SPSS, ArcGIS, and R Shiny, and have 
            hands-on experience in machine learning, network modeling, and predictive analytics. <br>
            My ultimate goal is to pioneer new ways to integrate healthcare, data, and technology—unlocking innovations that improve health outcomes for all.
