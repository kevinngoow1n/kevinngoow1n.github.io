        <h2>FMPH491 Modeling Infectious Diseases Final Project</h2>
        <p><strong>Background:</strong> Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) is a blood-borne virus, which if untreated can lead to liver failure and death over several decades. In 2016, the World Health Organization issued global HCV elimination goals, which include reducing the number of new HCV infections by 80% by 2030, with an interim target of reducing incidence by 30% by 2020 (from 2016 baseline levels). In the U.S., the vast majority of new infections occur among people who inject drugs (PWID). The U.S. National Academies of Sciences committed to the WHO elimination goals, but the level of intervention scale-up needed to reach the incidence targets is unknown.</p> 
        <br><br> 
        <p><strong>Project:</strong> Imagine it is 2016, and you need to tell policymakers in the U.S. what they need to do to reach the 2020 interim incidence target among PWID. You will be given one HCV intervention, and assess what level of intervention scale-up is required to achieve the 30% reduction in incidence target among PWID from 2016-2020.</p>
        <br><br>
        <p>For simplicity (and because intervention coverage is low among PWID) you can assume that at baseline in 2016 (and prior) there is no intervention among PWID: <strong>HCV treatment (~95% cure, does not protect against reinfection)</strong></p>
