        <h2>Qualcomm Institute Research COVID-19 Prediction Model & Tableau Dashboard</h2>
        <p>Most of the files and presentation created during this project were stored on my student account that was unfortunately deleted as soon as I graduated from UC San Diego in 2023. Nonetheless, however, this project encompassed the collection of various data sources such as Apple, Google, and Waze Mobility Reports, Yelp Reviews, news web scraping, state policies, Facebook movement range maps, COVIDcast API, San Diego County COVID statistics, voting and mask usage statistics, US Census Data, TSA/Flight Data, Snapchat SnapMap Geolocation Sensors, and Safegraph Foot Traffic Patterns. From these datasets, we performed step level bootstrapping analyses to filter out features that were not as important to the overall model and then went on to create the prediction models using different machine learning techniques. From the simple regressions to the most complex neural network models, we evaluated the AUC values for each prediction model, compared them to the real COVID-19 case data that was being outputted by the San Diego County and found that the the best prediction model was the random forest model. Throughout the process, we used Python and Tableau to clean, merge, filter, and visualize the data and create the prediction models. The attached files are early versions of some of the data analysis and visualizations that were going on in the project.</p>
