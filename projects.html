                <li><a href="https://kevinngoow1n.shinyapps.io/hiv_cluster_oregon_dashbaord/" target="_blank">Oregon Health Authority HIV Cluster Dashboard</a></li>
                <p>I developed this R Shiny dashboard while working with the Oregon Health Authority HIV/STD Division. The dashboard attached resembles what would have been used within meetings to explain and display vital information about HIV clusters in Oregon. The data and information presented within the dashboard are randomly generated and do not represent real data that was used.</p>
                <li>CA Notify Dashboard</li>
                <p>I developed this Data Studio (now called Looker Studio) dashboard while working under the CA Notify project for UC San Diego and the California Department of Public Health. The dashboard was used to display the current performance of the CA Notify system to UC San Diego and CDPH employees as well as the California governor at the time. When in use, the dashboard pulled data from various sources such as autopopulating google sheets (via webscraping), google analytics, SQL, AWS, and other databases developed by Apple and Google. The data and information presented within the dashboard are randomly generated and do not represent real data that was used.</p>
                <li>*Tableau Dashboards</li>
                <li>Call Center Dashboard (for COVID Outreach)</li>
                <p>I developed this Data Studio (now called Looker Studio) dashboard while working with the UC San Diego Business Outreach program where groups of volunteers called or visited local San Diego businesses to provide them information about operating practices and resources during the COVID-19 lockdowns. Outreach information was then recorded and visualized within this dashboard. The data and information presented within the dashboard are randomly generated and do not represent real data that was used.</p>

                <li><a href="assets/projects/USP4 Final Project Presentation.pdf" target="_blank">ArcGIS Project USP4</a></li>
                <p>A simple research project relating to the prevalence of COVID-19 and the median income within each county. This project involved my usage of ArcGIS to clean, organize, and visualize the data.</p>
